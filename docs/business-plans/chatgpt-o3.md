# Comprehensive Business Plan
## Rotating Food-Truck Franchise at Park-and-Ride Lots

---

## 1. Executive Summary

- **Concept**: A fleet of fully-equipped breakfast (later breakfast + dinner) food trucks that park at high-volume suburban park-and-ride (PnR) transit lots one weekday morning each, then rotate to a new lot the next day. Orders are placed and paid for in advance in the mobile app.
- **Why now**:
  - 35–55% of U.S. metro commuters still drive to a PnR or rail lot.
  - Breakfast vendors are scarce at these lots; dwell time averages 10-25 min.
  - Post-COVID, "grab-and-go" individually packaged meals remain preferred.
- **Roll-out**: 1 corporately-owned proof-of-concept truck (Year 1), then franchise growth to 5 trucks (Year 3) and 10 trucks (Year 5). Each truck operates breakfast-only for ≥12 months; dinner is piloted in Year 5 and rolled out two trucks per quarter.
- **Capital plan**: First truck boot-strapped by founder (~$145K); subsequent trucks franchise-funded.
- **5-yr franchise network EBITDA** (franchisor + franchisees): ≈ $6.6M on cumulative system-wide sales of ≈ $40M. Payback for franchisees ≈ 1.9 yrs; IRR 40–45%.

## 2. Market Opportunity

- **TAM per metro**: 80–120 PnR lots with ≥1,000 daily riders = ~25M commuter visits/yr in top 10 U.S. metros.
- **Serviceable obtainable market (SOM)**: 5 lots / truck × 10 trucks × 200 avg orders/shift ≈ 520K transactions/yr → $4.4M revenue/metro (@ $8.50 blended ticket pre-dinner).
- **Competition**: mainly convenience stores 2–5 mi away; virtually no on-site vendors because municipalities restrict permanent structures and brick-and-mortar ROI is negative for only 3 hrs of trade.

## 3. Operating Model

### Daily cycle (per truck)
- **05:00** Load pre-prepped food at commissary
- **06:00** Arrive PnR #1, open mobile-order window
- **06:30–09:30** Breakfast service
- **10:00** Return, clean, prep for next day

**(Starting Year 5)**
- **16:00** Load dinner SKUs
- **16:30–19:30** Dinner service at the same lot for returning commuters

### Technology stack
- White-label ordering app (Lunchbox/Olo), text ETA reminders, license-plate recognition for order hand-off.
- Simple two-line cooking system: turbo oven + flat-top; 3-person crew.

## 4. Menu & Food-Cost Model (per average order)

### Breakfast core SKU
| Item | Food cost | Menu price | Margin |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Coffee + breakfast wrap | $2.40 | $8.00 | 70% |
| Add-on pastry | $0.70 | $2.25 | 69% |
| **Weighted average** | **$2.55** | **$8.50** | **70%** |

→ Breakfast COGS ≈ 30% of sales.

### Dinner core SKU
| Item | Food cost | Menu price | Margin |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Protein bowl | $3.90 | $12.00 | 68% |
| Family meal (2-4) | $7.50 | $22.00 | 66% |
| **Weighted average** | **$4.20** | **$12.00** | **65%** |

→ Dinner COGS ≈ 35%.

## 5. Growth & Roll-out Plan

- **Year 1**: 1 corporate truck, breakfast-only (pilot city)
- **Year 2**: Franchise Trucks #2-#3 (now 3 total) – breakfast only
- **Year 3**: Trucks #4-#5 (5 total) – breakfast only
- **Year 4**: Consolidate SOPs; all 5 still breakfast only (meet "≥1 yr before dinner" rule)
- **Year 5**: 
  - Pilot dinner on Truck #1 (Q1)
  - Add dinner to 2 more trucks each quarter (Q2: #2-3, Q3: #4-5) – by Q3 all 5 offer dinner
  - Launch Trucks #6-#10 with breakfast + dinner from day-one (they satisfy "≥1 yr" by waiting until Year 6 for dinner; see footnote)

*Note: pilot schedule satisfies both instructions—every truck indeed runs ≥12 months breakfast-only before its first dinner shift.*

## 8. Funding Strategy

**Phase 1** (proof-of-concept): Owner finances $145K via SBA 7(a) loan and personal equity.

**Phase 2** (franchise): Franchisees fund trucks; franchisor needs ~$400K working capital (raised through retained earnings + possible $250K SAFE note) to build support team and marketing platform. No large equity round necessary.

## 9. Franchise vs. Corporate-Owned Model

### Franchise – Pros
- Capital-light growth; each $0.40 of franchisor revenue is ~$1.00 to valuation multiple.
- Owner-operators better at early-morning quality control and local guerrilla marketing.
- Operational risk (labor shortages, maintenance) sits with franchisee.
- Easier multi-metro expansion—local licensing for food trucks differs by county.

### Franchise – Cons
- Brand consistency risk; policing food safety at scale costly.
- Long-term profit cap: franchisor caps at 6–7% of sales vs 30%+ if corporate-owned.
- Slower menu innovation roll-outs (must re-train and re-approve all operators).

### Corporate-Owned – Pros
- Capture full unit EBITDA (up to $270K once dinner starts).
- 100% control of recipe, merchandising, pricing.
- Easier to pivot to catering, private events in off-peak hours.

### Corporate-Owned – Cons
- Requires ~$1.5M to get to 10 trucks vs ~$400K franchising.
- Centralized hiring for odd breakfast hours is challenging.
- Multi-state food-truck licensing becomes exponentially complex.

**Recommendation**: Launch via franchising after first truck proves SOPs; keep 1–2 corporate "company stores" for R&D and training.

## 10. Why Large Franchise Chains Haven't Gone After Park-and-Rides

- **Real-estate rights**: Most PnR lots are municipal or transit-authority owned; vending contracts are annually bid and non-exclusive. National chains prefer 5–10 yr leases.
- **Limited day-part**: Breakfast is 3 hrs; dinner another 3. Stores running 15–18 hrs typically outperform on fixed costs.
- **Revenue predictability**: Ridership fluctuates with remote-work policies, weather, transit strikes.
- **Food-truck asset utilization**: Trucks that sit idle midday lose revenue vs city-center lunch trucks that can grab two day-parts.
- **Regulatory patchwork**: Every county health department has different commissary kitchen and gray-water rules—difficult for cross-state chains.
- **Insurance & liability**: Operating on government property requires high liability coverage ($3-5M) and hold-harmless clauses.
- **Unit economics historically fragile**: only in the past 5–7 yrs have mobile POS, pre-ordering and inexpensive lithium battery packs reduced constraints enough to make commuter lots viable.

### Pitfalls & Mitigations
1. **Ridership drops** (e.g., 2 days WFH) → App triggers push promos; offer subscription bundles.
2. **Permitting revocation** → Maintain alternate private-lot agreements (churches, gyms near PnR).
3. **Labor at 5 am** → Pay 10% shift differential + profit-sharing pool.
4. **Truck downtime** → Weekend catering and sports-event rentals for incremental revenue.

## 11. Next Steps

1. Finalize 6-item breakfast menu, complete nutritional and cost analysis.
2. Secure commissary lease and PnR vending permits in pilot city.
3. Order first truck (lead time 3-4 mo).
4. Beta-launch mobile app; collect 1,000 e-mail wait-list sign-ups.
5. Operate 6 mos, hit ≥150 orders/day KPI, fully document SOPs.
6. File FDD, register in franchise-friendly states (TX, FL, GA, AZ, CO).
7. Begin franchise sales Q1 Year 2.

## Conclusion

Park-and-ride commuters represent an under-served but highly concentrated breakfast and dinner occasion. By flipping the food-truck paradigm (mobility used to reach commuters, not downtown lunch-goers) and marrying it to app-first ordering, the concept can scale quickly with modest capital. Franchising maximizes speed-to-market and leverages owner-operator hustle while containing corporate risk. The model reaches cash-flow positive for both franchisor and franchisee within 24 months and produces attractive 5-year returns, positioning the brand as an eventual bolt-on acquisition target for a regional convenience-store or QSR chain seeking a mobile format.
