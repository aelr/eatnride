# Comprehensive Business Plan: EAT n RIDE - Rotating Food Truck Franchise

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Concept:** EAT n RIDE is a proposed food truck franchise poised to capture the underserved market of daily commuters at major metropolitan park-and-ride (PnR) locations. The concept begins with a convenient, high-quality breakfast offering, emphasizing mobile app-based pre-ordering for speed and efficiency. As the brand establishes itself and scales, a dinner service will be introduced to cater to returning commuters. Each truck will rotate between 5 PnR lots, serving one lot each weekday.

**Market Need & Opportunity:** A significant percentage (35-55%) of U.S. metro commuters utilize PnR lots, where breakfast and convenient dinner options are often scarce. Commuter dwell time at these lots (10-25 minutes) provides a window for service. Post-COVID, demand for "grab-and-go" and individually packaged meals remains high. This model aims to fill this niche by bringing the service directly to a captive audience.

**Business Model & Roll-out:**
*   **Year 1 (Pilot):** Launch one corporately-owned and founder-operated truck in a pilot city (e.g., a suitable metro area in Pennsylvania to align with initial regulatory research). This phase will focus on proving the concept, perfecting Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), establishing supplier chains, and refining the menu. All operations will adhere to Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) guidelines for Mobile Food Facilities (MFFs), including commissary use and Food Employee Certification.
*   **Years 2-4 (Franchise Growth - Breakfast):** Begin franchising, aiming for 5 total operational trucks (1 corporate, 4 franchisee-owned) by the end of Year 3. All trucks will initially offer breakfast-only service for at least their first 12 months of operation.
*   **Year 5+ (Dinner Expansion & Continued Growth):**
    *   **Year 5, Q1:** The pilot corporate truck will introduce dinner service.
    *   **Year 5, Q2-Q3:** Franchisee trucks #2-5 will sequentially add dinner service (two per quarter) after completing their initial 12+ months of breakfast-only operation.
    *   **Year 5 onwards:** Continue franchise expansion, aiming for 10 total trucks. New trucks will operate breakfast-only for their first year, then add dinner.

**Financial & Funding:**
*   **Pilot Truck:** Initial funding for the first truck (estimated $115K - $150K for truck, outfitting, initial permits, inventory, and working capital) will be bootstrapped by the founder, potentially with an SBA 7(a) loan.
*   **Franchise Expansion:** Subsequent trucks will be franchisee-funded. The franchisor will require working capital (estimated ~$400K over time, potentially from retained earnings or a SAFE note) to build the franchise support system.
*   **Projected Economics (Illustrative):**
    *   Franchisee EBITDA (per truck, breakfast-only): ≈ $78K (25% margin on ~$318K revenue).
    *   Franchisee EBITDA (per truck, breakfast + dinner): ≈ $214K (31% margin on ~$678K revenue).
    *   Franchisee payback: ≈ 1.9 years (breakfast-only), improving significantly with dinner.
    *   5-Year franchise network EBITDA (franchisor + franchisees combined) is projected to be substantial, demonstrating strong potential for profitability.

**Competitive Advantage:** EAT n RIDE differentiates itself by:
*   Targeting a specific, underserved commuter niche at PnR lots.
*   Utilizing a mobile app for efficient pre-ordering and payment.
*   Implementing a rotating schedule to maximize asset utilization (1 truck serves 5 locations).
*   Focusing on quality, speed, and convenience.
*   Building a scalable franchise model after a proven pilot.

This business plan outlines the market opportunity, detailed operational strategy (including compliance with PA regulations), franchise model benefits, marketing plans, and financial projections, demonstrating a strong potential for a profitable and scalable venture.
